# MLP-Optimization

## Introduction

For my research project, I'll intend to use neural networks to perform predictive analytics on time series datasets. I'll 
also perform hyperparameter optimization on nueral networks that are made based on the dataset being analyzed and the 
interpretation objective. The goal is to find trends of the most optimal hyperparameters based on variations in the 
properties of data and the interpretation objective.
